# CS-330

## **How do I approach designing software?**
When designing software, I first make sure I'm aware of all the requirements. I then take the approach of breaking the project up into different components, and try and complete each component piece by piece. I also want to test frequently, ensuring that I can debug along the way without running into any major issues that I lose track of. Incorporating a design that is simple is important for me as well, as over complicating can cause major issues. I try and stick with creating an MVP in most cases first. 

## **How do I approach developing programs?**
When developing programs, my main approach is to ensure I using appropriate coding practices. I want to ensure that my code is neat, well organized, and well commented to allow the user to be able to read and follow along with my code. The final project for CS-330 has helped me develop new organization methods for my code, where I seperated some code into seperate files in order to organize the project for easy readability. Tactics that I've applied in this project that I will use in the future will the overarching coding practices that I used throughout the semester. 

## **How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
While working with graphics and design during CS330, I learned new skills as well as sharpened old skills that I'll continue building on in the future. The approaches I took while creating my final project, as well as the smaller assignments, are skills that will help me professionally. These skills include organization, good coding practices, and debugging.
